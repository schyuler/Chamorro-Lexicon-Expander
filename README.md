# Chamorro-Lexicon-Expander

Chamorro Lexicon Expander is a Python project designed to expand the Chamorro-English dictionary by generating all possible affixed variations of Chamorro root words. This tool automates the process of creating word forms using common Chamorro prefixes, suffixes, and infixes according to linguistic rules. This project enables a more comprehensive representation of Chamorro vocabulary for language learners, linguists, and dictionary development. (In Progress)
