# Chamorro-Lexicon-Expander

Chamorro Lexicon Expander is a Python project designed to expand the Chamorro-English dictionary by generating all possible affixed variations of Chamorro root words. This tool automates the process of creating word forms using common Chamorro prefixes, suffixes, and infixes according to linguistic rules. This project enables a more comprehensive representation of Chamorro vocabulary for language learners and dictionary development. (In Progress)

**Important Note:** The focus of this project is testing out applying affixes algorithmically to words according to linguistic rules, to experiment with ways to expedite creating word lists with known affixes. But the words generated may or may not be accurate to how they are used in natural speech.
