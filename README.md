# Chamorro-Lexicon-Expander

Chamorro Lexicon Expander is a Python project designed to expand the Chamorro-English dictionary by generating all possible affixed variations of Chamorro root words. This tool automates the process of creating word forms using common Chamorro prefixes, suffixes, and infixes according to linguistic rules. This project enables a more comprehensive representation of Chamorro vocabulary for language learners and dictionary development. (In Progress)

**Important Note:** This project will be testing out applying affixes to words according to linguistic rules, but the words generated may or may not be accurate to how they are used in speech. I try my best to select words that, according to their part of speech classification, can be transformed with the different affixes. But the resulting transformed words may or may not align with what is actually said in natural speech.
